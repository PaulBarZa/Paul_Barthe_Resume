# English and French resume

Latex is mostly used in maths and science but in this case it is used to create my resume. Find more about [LaTeX here.](http://www.latex-project.org/)

You can find and download the **moderncv** template I used for this resume: http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/

The resume that inspired and convinced me to choose this template: https://github.com/mliu7/latex-moderncv
